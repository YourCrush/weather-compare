# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Weather Comparison App is a web application that allows users to compare weather conditions across multiple cities simultaneously. The app addresses the common need for people considering relocation or travel to understand weather differences between locations. Users can compare current conditions, historical data, and forecasts for up to 3 cities side-by-side, with multiple visualization options and export capabilities. The application will be built as a static single-page application hosted on GitHub Pages, using Open-Meteo APIs for weather data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user considering relocation, I want to automatically see weather data for my current location, so that I have an immediate baseline for comparison.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL attempt to get the user's current location via browser geolocation
2. IF geolocation is denied or unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to IP-based location detection
3. IF both geolocation methods fail THEN the system SHALL display a search box for manual location entry
4. WHEN location is determined THEN the system SHALL display current weather conditions for that location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add up to 2 additional cities for comparison, so that I can see weather differences across multiple locations simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user searches for a city THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions using Open-Meteo Geocoding API
2. WHEN the user selects a city THEN the system SHALL add it to the comparison view
3. IF the user tries to add more than 2 additional cities THEN the system SHALL prevent the addition and show a message
4. WHEN cities are added THEN the system SHALL display weather data for all selected locations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see comprehensive weather data for each location, so that I can make informed comparisons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying current conditions THEN the system SHALL show temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed/gust, precipitation details, cloud cover, pressure, UV index, and sunrise/sunset times
2. WHEN displaying past 7 days THEN the system SHALL show daily min/max temperatures, precipitation totals, average humidity, and average/max wind speeds
3. WHEN displaying next 7-10 days forecast THEN the system SHALL show temperature forecasts, precipitation probability and totals, wind, and humidity
4. WHEN displaying historical data THEN the system SHALL show 24 months of monthly averages including temperature ranges, precipitation totals, wet days, humidity, and wind data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want multiple ways to visualize weather comparisons, so that I can understand the data in the format that works best for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in Summary mode THEN the system SHALL display at-a-glance insights comparing cities with calculated differences
2. WHEN in Side-by-side Cards mode THEN the system SHALL display current, past 7 days, and next 7 days data in card format for each city
3. WHEN in Charts mode THEN the system SHALL display line charts for temperature trends, bar charts for precipitation, and line charts for wind data
4. WHEN viewing historical charts THEN the system SHALL display 24-month trend lines for multiple cities on the same chart
5. WHEN in Seasonal Outlook mode THEN the system SHALL compare current week data with the same week from the previous year

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the display settings, so that I can view data in my preferred format and units.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user toggles units THEN the system SHALL switch between metric and imperial measurements
2. WHEN the user toggles theme THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark modes
3. WHEN viewing charts THEN the user SHALL be able to toggle between shared y-axis and auto-scale options
4. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL persist preferences in localStorage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my favorite locations, so that I can quickly access them in future sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds cities THEN the system SHALL offer to save them as favorites
2. WHEN favorites are saved THEN the system SHALL store them in localStorage
3. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL automatically load the user's last selected cities
4. WHEN the user accesses favorites THEN the system SHALL display a quick-select menu

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export and share weather comparisons, so that I can save or communicate findings with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests PNG export THEN the system SHALL generate a screenshot using html2canvas
2. WHEN the user requests CSV export THEN the system SHALL export the current chart's dataset in CSV format
3. WHEN the user requests a shareable link THEN the system SHALL encode selected cities, active view, units, and theme in the URL
4. WHEN someone accesses a shared link THEN the system SHALL restore the exact view configuration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the app to be fully accessible, so that I can use it regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide proper tab order and focus indicators
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide ARIA labels for all interactive elements
3. WHEN viewing charts THEN the system SHALL provide table summaries as fallbacks for screen readers
4. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to work well on my device, so that I can check weather comparisons on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that works on screens as small as 360px
2. WHEN interacting on touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and gestures
3. WHEN loading on slower connections THEN the system SHALL show loading states and handle timeouts gracefully

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully, so that I can still use it even when data is temporarily unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL display "Data unavailable" placeholders instead of breaking
2. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and retry options
3. WHEN cached data is available THEN the system SHALL use it while attempting to fetch fresh data
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately without exposing technical details to users

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast performance, so that I can quickly get the weather information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching current and forecast data THEN the system SHALL cache responses for 15 minutes
2. WHEN fetching historical data THEN the system SHALL cache responses for 24 hours
3. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display initial content within 3 seconds on typical connections
4. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL respond immediately using cached data when available
